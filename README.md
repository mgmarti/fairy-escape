# Fairy Escape

## Homework 4
Create another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, your app must dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library.

## Requirements
- There will be four real-world items (food, gems, magical items) displayed as image buttons on the page. (Pick a theme, find images of your items to display to the player).

- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

- Each item should have a random associated value chosen by the computer.

- When the player clicks one of the items, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

    - Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks an item.
    - When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
    - The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

- The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

- When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the objects will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
- The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
